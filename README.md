# Software_Books_&_Courses-Notes
## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)
Purpose of this docs: I hope you are an employer or even a fellow software engineer but mainly this docs is to show I have a skill of learening from great literautre and teaching/courses. I not only am good at leanring but applying it and using it fast. being flexible yet staying with solid principles.  I have shared some experiences and maybe some code to show at least an understadning or attempt at showing a level of mastery over good subject matter.  As Stepehn Covey put it "Sharpening the Saw."
experience and thoughts get to know my experience and so forth and my learning Books(print and e-books), online Courses thorugh Udemy, Front End Masters, Lynda.com(also LInkedIN Learning), Full Univeristy courese(OPen Course ware from top universitites like harvard <MIT Standford etc) so instead of a Ceritifcate here is some of a journal of learning. 
Profesor Kearl was known for his rgiourous tests and baosted optoins A-k on the exam which is claimed to only get you pan A if you really thourhgoly undertaood the content not just memorized stuff.  He did one thing each period I loved. The pop quiz was a quesiton liek waht is Law of demand and suply and we had ot write a paragrpah on one side of the card and tehn find a real world exmaple demontstraing it and write how and so forht. basically immediately apply to real world a concept. in the rela world not jsut a book.  also the writing and not jsut chosoing a-e or what not. I try to keep doing that with all that I learn. This si jsut a part of that process to master/understand content not jsut memorize or rea thorugh know stuff. 

I believe education is key to any career. Always learning and being ablet o learn a new technology is exptermely improtant in todays tech world. Since I did not gradute as a CS degree yet work in the tech space my erly goal was to educate myself with teh smae if not more knowledge than any colelgee eduacted person IN Cs or simialr. 


Public speaking - debate class -  5 years teaching and leadereship experince - OTHER SKILLS put this in the section about the book  use teh SARS to write up interview questions. answers like projects answers just put it all in there.  JS ahrd parts technincal communication precisions. 
###### [Beginning Software Engineering by Rod Stephens](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781119209515)
>definition : An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software. (p. xxii)

Or it is everything you need to do to create successful software. 

Raw idea turned into powerful intuitive application that can be enhanced to meet customer needs.Its not physcial so it can changed after production unlike other engineering like a bridge or plane cabin.

Planning 
step 1. customer needs and wants - requirements - this is important cause bugs multiply as the process goes further if this stage is not fully understood 

documenting changes and reasons and so forth set up an email with the project name and cc all communication etc.  google docs with every one has their own color or something to keep history

###### JavaScript: The Hard Parts - Front End Masters course by Codesmith CEO
Course Completed 11 MAR 2018 :  -  I have about 7 double sided large notecards with the knowledge from that course:
all inteded to go in depth under the hood of JavaScript to write more efiiceint cleaner easier to de bug code. 
1. Javascript Platform : Callstack, Execution Context, Variable Environment, Thread (later Web API, Event Loop, callback/messages) 
2. Callbacks and Higher Order functions 
3. OOP JS approach - rebuild the new keyword from scratch.  etc
4. Closure a HOF -
5. Asynchronous JS 
5/5 for my rating on this course. Some of the best teaching I have seen. bar none. 


###### Cracking the Coding Interveiew (189 ... 6th edition )
projects in off time
Language (expert level, skill level)
Knowing Only One or Two Languages: The more time you've spent coding, the more things you've
built, the more languages you will have tended to work with. The assumption then, when they see a
resume with only one language, is that you haven't experienced very many problems. They also often
worry that candidates with only one or two languages will have trouble learning new technologies (why
hasn't the candidate learned more things?) or will just feel too tied with a specific technology (poten-
tially not using the best language for the task).
There is a belief in many circles that the best software engineers don't define themselves around
a particular language.
Where possible, try to truly diversify. The languages in the cluster of {Python, Ruby, and JavaScript} are
somewhat similar to each other. It's better if you can learn languages that are more different, like Python,
C++, and Java.
Build projects outside
of school/ work.
Learn multiple
programming
Expand Network
Build websi te / port-
folio showcasing your
languages
Implement data struc-
tures and algorithms
from scratch
Form mock interview
group with friends to
interview each other.Do several mock inter-
views.Do mini-projects to
solidify understanding
of key concepts .
Create list to track
mistakes you've made
solvinq problems.
Rehearse stories
from the interview

###### [Becoming a better programmer by PETE goodliffe](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033929.do)
care about making truly great software  that is the goal 
note : i like making great user wxperiences and utikity better life 
https://nostarch.com/codecraft   also of interest by same author 

ACCU CHECKOUT https://accu.org/ professionlaism in programming and conference for becoming a better programmer
Elephantine monstrosities thatvthe rarst of us have ti ckean uo  TOW DVI AT MY CURENT JOB
KEY :to wrote good code you have to care a bout it . .. to beicme a better orogramer you must invest time and effirt 
attidute  is the diffeence between medicire and greta programmers .how i apply this  i cannot pove i memrized or oeefectly know all this but have taken ccopius notes amd have examoles of applying it 
care thisbis the while beginning of tit  to show it prove it  examole in ym code aniooetes befire afwr 
*Presentation(writing clean maintainable code bug free)*
I have experienced first hand seeminlgy good devs (not making a total judgemnt on them) but even my CTO Slacked out he prefers 4 spaces so liets gget rid of all that otehr stuff.  Others have told me 2 spapcecs is jsut not legible yet I inspected many world fmaous prjoects like Googles aANgural seemingly written with 2 spaces.  Then read about all the beenfits like less code with 2 and on and on.  The tips in this chapter seems very true the opinion of the authors state tath good pgrammers rise above the squablle and while caring deeply about the presentatoin of their code jsut have a "healthy attidtue about it and act like grown ups. That is how I felt anyways and think higher ups should decide on code stule and have a style guide as with the famou (2 million downlads per month at time of this post) Airbnb Style guide.  I don't get opinionated I jsut make sure my code presentation its consistentn and "shows my intent" as the author suggests. Efficent, maintainable code ultimatey avoid bugs in your code . People and the compiler  

clean code

 ###### CS 50  harvard 
 A popular speaker and autheor for Codinng interviwewing and so forth said you shaould have a solid foundatoin in CS to work at the "big 4".  So I studied all the topics hse recommended and then decided i wanted to get the same educaiton that was given to CS grads so gratefully Many great schools (the best ones reallY) have free course content available which I started with HArvards famous intro to prgrogramming course cs50 and the course jsut goes over the basics of programming in general with the classic exmaple of making a PB and J sandwich with an algortithm.  comuters only do exaclty what you tell them to do so be specific, exact and thorugugh. 
 
###### Harvard Intor to ALgorithms coursse with text Introudciotn to Algorithms
known as the algorithms s=ible basically in many posts that I read; I quote if you wan tot be aworld class engieer take this cousres and do it in 2 while without it you would take 10 - execlelent programmer


###### LSAT logic games Kaplan/GMAT 
Steve Jobs said - everyone should learn  the skills from , skills problems solving and so forth analtyicla all that so GMAt and this books 

resume  buldier stuff  
projects   perosnal communicty open aiurce  freelance 
jobs - accalades stats
langaauges mastey - code wars tyie and expeoence and write stuff tutoials etc or aoemthjng wirk exampels 

improve hiw what parts 

###### Learning Web app Development  (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030621.do)
