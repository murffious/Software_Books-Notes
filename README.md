# Software_Books_&_Courses-Notes
## Why? 

Purpose of this docs: Take notes to review and master new content in my quest to be a truly versatile yet specialized software engineer. I believe education is key to any career. Always learning and being able to learn a new technology is exptermely improtant in today's tech world. 

###### [Learning to Program by Steven Foote] (https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-to-program/9780133795257/)
p.31 - A cool "WHY" to writing clean code and why code breaks wihtout perfect semi colon and what not. "Knowing that my code must be translated [into 1s, and 0s] before being executed helped me understand; if the instructions have typos or errors, the programming language will not be able to properly translate to binary"

###### [The Object-Oriented Thought Process] (https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/the-object-oriented-thought/9780133090659/)
-object wrappers- take a structured module and wrap inside an object to make it look like an object. 
objects defined - `an entity that contains both data and behavior`
procedural programming - code is placed into functions or procedures where inputs go in and outputs come out. data or  attributes and methods or behaviors are separate unlike OOP where both are combined, in OOP no such things as global data when properly designed which helps protect intended use, ENCAPSULATION. Restricting access to attributes/methods is data hiding. Best practices: Smaller objects with specific tasks is generally better and objects shoud not manipulate the internal data of other objects.   
###### [Building Web Apps with WordPress] (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029380.do)
Difference between a web app and a web site. Here are some features that might make something a web app although they can seem similar to a site at first glance: More interactive elements, Tasks rather than content, Logins, Device capabilities, Work offline, API Mashups etc. WP started as a blogging platform and evolved into a fully functional content management system (CMS) built on PHP/SQL/JS. Why use WP? 55,070 (27000+ free) plugins (as of 2018 Apr), security, user management etc. but really it claims to be cheaper than like a .NET dev setup. 

###### [Begin to Code with C#] (Microsoft)
>Programmers who can communicate well get the most money and the interesting work ... they are the ones who can sell their ideas and are best at talking to customers to find out what the customer wants. (p. 23) 
This is a similar idea that CEO of Codesmith says that you can be a great programmer if you write code quickly and meet the given requirements but world class engineers are good at technical communication. 

###### Essentials of C# (Lynda.com)
Overload - two methods with the same name but different signature - method signature refers to return type, name, name and type of arguments - this is a form of polymorphism 
 Type required for arguments

Inheritance: 
Vocal: function body expression  like arrow function is js but more simple only 

Math.  Then has list of static methods i.e. not needing instantiation of the class 

Inherit toStirng and we want to override it 
Public override string ToString()
{
	var sb = new StringBuilder() 
Sb.APpendLIne 
	return base.ToString();
sb.ToString(). Made the default ToString more useful 
}
XAML for new windows stuff 

Abstract class. Base class cannot instantiate directly

Virtual be overridden later
Interface common behaviors one class. : like inheritance 
value built in
Get set has auto properties in visual studio 
Then you can breakout out and do logic 
Encapsulated property 
Access modifier 
There are four access modifiers in C#,Â public, private, protected, and internal. Inheritance is related to this
Encapsulation of the property 
 
ctor hot key 


###### [Beginning Software Engineering by Rod Stephens](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781119209515)
>definition : An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software. (p. xxii)

Or it is everything you need to do to create successful software. 

Raw idea turned into powerful intuitive application that can be enhanced to meet customer needs.Its not physcial so it can changed after production unlike other engineering like a bridge or plane cabin.

Planning 
step 1. customer needs and wants - requirements - this is important cause bugs multiply as the process goes further if this stage is not fully understood 

documenting changes and reasons and so forth set up an email with the project name and cc all communication etc.  google docs with every one has their own color or something to keep history

###### JavaScript: The Hard Parts - Front End Masters course by Codesmith CEO
Course Completed 11 MAR 2018 :  -  I have about 7 double sided large notecards with the knowledge from that course:
all inteded to go in depth under the hood of JavaScript to write more efiiceint cleaner easier to de bug code. 
1. Javascript Platform : Callstack, Execution Context, Variable Environment, Thread (later Web API, Event Loop, callback/messages) 
2. Callbacks and Higher Order functions 
3. OOP JS approach - rebuild the new keyword from scratch.  etc
4. Closure a HOF -
5. Asynchronous JS 
5/5 for my rating on this course. Some of the best teaching I have seen. bar none. 


###### Cracking the Coding Interveiew (189 ... 6th edition )
projects in off time
Language (expert level, skill level)
Knowing Only One or Two Languages: The more time you've spent coding, the more things you've
built, the more languages you will have tended to work with. The assumption then, when they see a
resume with only one language, is that you haven't experienced very many problems. They also often
worry that candidates with only one or two languages will have trouble learning new technologies (why
hasn't the candidate learned more things?) or will just feel too tied with a specific technology (poten-
tially not using the best language for the task).
There is a belief in many circles that the best software engineers don't define themselves around
a particular language.
Where possible, try to truly diversify. The languages in the cluster of {Python, Ruby, and JavaScript} are
somewhat similar to each other. It's better if you can learn languages that are more different, like Python,
C++, and Java.
Build projects outside
of school/ work.

What You'd Do Differently

Along the top, as columns, you should list all the major aspects of your resume, including each project, job,
or activity. Along the side, as rows, you should list the common behavioral questions.
When asked about your weaknesses, give a real weakness! Answers like "My greatest weakness is that I
work too hard" tell your interviewer that you're arrogant and/or won't admit to your faults. A good answer
conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it.

###### [Becoming a better programmer by PETE goodliffe](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033929.do)
care about making truly great software  that is the goal 
note : i like making great user wxperiences and utikity better life 
https://nostarch.com/codecraft   also of interest by same author 

ACCU CHECKOUT https://accu.org/ professionlaism in programming and conference for becoming a better programmer
Elephantine monstrosities thatvthe rarst of us have ti ckean uo  TOW DVI AT MY CURENT JOB
KEY :to wrote good code you have to care a bout it . .. to beicme a better orogramer you must invest time and effirt 
attidute  is the diffeence between medicire and greta programmers .how i apply this  i cannot pove i memrized or oeefectly know all this but have taken ccopius notes amd have examoles of applying it

*Presentation(writing clean maintainable code bug free)*
I have experienced first hand seeminlgy good devs (not making a total judgemnt on them) but even my CTO Slacked out he prefers 4 spaces so liets gget rid of all that otehr stuff.  Others have told me 2 spapcecs is jsut not legible yet I inspected many world fmaous prjoects like Googles aANgural seemingly written with 2 spaces.  Then read about all the beenfits like less code with 2 and on and on.  The tips in this chapter seems very true the opinion of the authors state tath good pgrammers rise above the squablle and while caring deeply about the presentatoin of their code jsut have a "healthy attidtue about it and act like grown ups. That is how I felt anyways and think higher ups should decide on code stule and have a style guide as with the famou (2 million downlads per month at time of this post) Airbnb Style guide.  I don't get opinionated I jsut make sure my code presentation its consistentn and "shows my intent" as the author suggests. Efficent, maintainable code ultimatey avoid bugs in your code . People and the compiler  

clean code

 ###### CS 50  harvard 
 A popular speaker and autheor for Codinng interviwewing and so forth said you shaould have a solid foundatoin in CS to work at the "big 4".  So I studied all the topics hse recommended and then decided i wanted to get the same educaiton that was given to CS grads so gratefully Many great schools (the best ones reallY) have free course content available which I started with HArvards famous intro to prgrogramming course cs50 and the course jsut goes over the basics of programming in general with the classic exmaple of making a PB and J sandwich with an algortithm.  comuters only do exaclty what you tell them to do so be specific, exact and thorugugh. 
 
###### Harvard Intor to ALgorithms coursse with text Introudciotn to Algorithms
known as the algorithms s=ible basically in many posts that I read; I quote if you wan tot be aworld class engieer take this cousres and do it in 2 while without it you would take 10 - execlelent programmer


###### LSAT logic games Kaplan/GMAT 
Steve Jobs said - everyone should learn  the skills from , skills problems solving and so forth analtyicla all that so GMAt and this books 

resume  buldier stuff  
projects   perosnal communicty open aiurce  freelance 
jobs - accalades stats
langaauges mastey - code wars tyie and expeoence and write stuff tutoials etc or aoemthjng wirk exampels 

improve hiw what parts
