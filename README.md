Software Engineering definition : An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software. (p. xxii)
Or it is everything you need to do to create successful software. 

Raw idea turned into powerful intuitive application that can be enhanced to meet customer needs.Its not physcial so it can changed after production unlike other engineering like a bridge or plane cabin.

Planning 
step 1. customer needs and wants - requirements - this is important cause bugs multiply as the process goes further if this stage is not fully understood 

documenting changes and reasons and so forth set up an email with the project name and cc all communication etc.  google docs with every one has their own color or something to keep history

Language (expert level, skill level)
Knowing Only One or Two Languages: The more time you've spent coding, the more things you've
built, the more languages you will have tended to work with. The assumption then, when they see a
resume with only one language, is that you haven't experienced very many problems. They also often
worry that candidates with only one or two languages will have trouble learning new technologies (why
hasn't the candidate learned more things?) or will just feel too tied with a specific technology (poten-
tially not using the best language for the task).
