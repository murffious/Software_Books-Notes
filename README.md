# Software_Books_&_Courses-Notes
## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)
Purpose of this docs: I hope you are an employer or even a fellow software engineer but mainly this docs is to show I have a skill of learening from great literautre and teaching/courses. I not only am good at leanring but applying it and using it fast. being flexible yet staying with solid principles.  I have shared some experiences and maybe some code to show at least an understadning or attempt at showing a level of mastery over good subject matter.  As Stepehn Covey put it "Sharpening the Saw."
experience and thoughts get to know my experience and so forth and my learning Books(print and e-books), online Courses thorugh Udemy, Front End Masters, Lynda.com(also LInkedIN Learning), Full Univeristy courese(OPen Course ware from top universitites like harvard <MIT Standford etc) so instead of a Ceritifcate here is some of a journal of learning. 

I believe education is key to any career. Always learning and being ablet o learn a new technology is exptermely improtant in todays tech world. Since I did not gradute as a CS degree yet work in the tech space my erly goal was to educate myself with teh smae if not more knowledge than any colelgee eduacted person IN Cs or simialr. 



###### [Beginning Software Engineering by Rod Stephens](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781119209515)
>definition : An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software. (p. xxii)

Or it is everything you need to do to create successful software. 

Raw idea turned into powerful intuitive application that can be enhanced to meet customer needs.Its not physcial so it can changed after production unlike other engineering like a bridge or plane cabin.

Planning 
step 1. customer needs and wants - requirements - this is important cause bugs multiply as the process goes further if this stage is not fully understood 

documenting changes and reasons and so forth set up an email with the project name and cc all communication etc.  google docs with every one has their own color or something to keep history

###### JavaScript: The Hard Parts - Front End Masters course by Codesmith CEO
Course Completed 11 MAR 2018 :  -  I have about 7 double sided large notecards with the knowledge from that course:
all inteded to go in depth under the hood of JavaScript to write more efiiceint cleaner easier to de bug code. 
1. Javascript Platform : Callstack, Execution Context, Variable Environment, Thread (later Web API, Event Loop, callback/messages) 
2. Callbacks and Higher Order functions 
3. OOP JS approach - rebuild the new keyword from scratch.  etc
4. Closure a HOF -
5. Asynchronous JS 
5/5 for my rating on this course. Some of the best teaching I have seen. bar none. 


###### Cracking the Coding Interveiew (189 ... 6th edition )
projects in off time
Language (expert level, skill level)
Knowing Only One or Two Languages: The more time you've spent coding, the more things you've
built, the more languages you will have tended to work with. The assumption then, when they see a
resume with only one language, is that you haven't experienced very many problems. They also often
worry that candidates with only one or two languages will have trouble learning new technologies (why
hasn't the candidate learned more things?) or will just feel too tied with a specific technology (poten-
tially not using the best language for the task).


###### [Becoming a better programmer by PETE goodliffe](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033929.do)
care about making truly great software  that is the goal

I have experienced first hand seeminlgy good devs (not making a total judgemnt on them) but even my CTO Slacked out he prefers 4 spaces so liets gget rid of all that otehr stuff.  Others have told me 2 spapcecs is jsut not legible yet I inspected many world fmaous prjoects like Googles aANgural seemingly written with 2 spaces.  Then read about all the beenfits like less code with 2 and on and on.  The tips in this chapter seems very true the opinion of the authors state tath good pgrammers rise above the squablle and while caring deeply about the presentatoin of their code jsut have a "healthy attidtue about it and act like grown ups. That is how I felt anyways and think higher ups should decide on code stule and have a style guide as with the famou (2 million downlads per month at time of this post) Airbnb Style guide.  I don't get opinionated I jsut make sure my code presentation its consistentn and "shows my intent" as the author suggests. Efficent, maintainable code ultimatey avoid bugs in your code .
